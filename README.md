# WiLabVIsim

**_WiLabVIsim_** is a Matlab-based open-source simulator, designed specifically for analyzing radar-to-radar interference in a realistic vehicular scenario. This tool makes it possible to detect the number of potential interferers that each sensor perceives over time. 
The output includes information concerning the length of the interfering path, direction, position and speed of source and victim radars.
